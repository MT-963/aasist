# AASIST Model Enhancement Report

## Optimizations Implemented

1. **Performance Tracking**
   - Added progress reporting with ETA calculation to monitor training
   - Implemented batch-by-batch progress percentage display

2. **Memory Optimizations**
   - Added periodic CUDA cache clearing (`torch.cuda.empty_cache()`)
   - Reduced worker count (set to 2) to decrease memory usage
   - Added configurable cache size and prefetch factor

3. **Training Stability Improvements**
   - Implemented proper weight initialization for all layers
   - Added gradient clipping (max_norm=5.0) to prevent exploding gradients
   - Fixed NaN issues by adding small epsilon (1e-10) to attention map softmax

4. **Speed and Efficiency**
   - Enabled mixed precision training with GradScaler
   - Configured prefetch_factor to optimize data loading
   - Implemented learning rate warmup for better convergence

5. **Model Improvements**
   - Added Focal Loss implementation for handling class imbalance
   - Implemented Mixup augmentation for better generalization
   - Added frequency augmentation toggle for audio data

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **CUDA Out-of-Memory Errors**
   - **Problem**: RTX 3050 GPU had insufficient VRAM for large batch sizes
   - **Solution**: Reduced batch size, implemented cache clearing, optimized workers

2. **Slow Training**
   - **Problem**: 4 hours per epoch was too slow for practical development
   - **Solution**: Enabled mixed precision training, optimized data loading pipeline

3. **Poor Initial Performance (50% EER)**
   - **Problem**: Model was essentially random guessing
   - **Solution**: Fixed weight initialization, implemented proper augmentation techniques

4. **NaN Errors**
   - **Problem**: Training diverged due to numerical instability
   - **Solution**: Added epsilon to softmax calculations, implemented gradient clipping

## Failures and Challenges

1. **Initial Training Attempts**
   - **Failure**: First training runs crashed with CUDA out-of-memory errors
   - **Reason**: Original batch size (64) was too large for RTX 3050 GPU (4GB VRAM)
   - **Lesson**: Hardware limitations need to be considered when designing training pipeline

2. **Model Weight Initialization**
   - **Failure**: Random performance even after several epochs
   - **Reason**: Improper initialization led to poor gradient flow through the network
   - **Impact**: Model was starting from a bad initialization point, making convergence difficult

3. **Numerical Instability**
   - **Failure**: NaN values appearing during training
   - **Reason**: Softmax operations on attention maps without epsilon safeguards
   - **Impact**: Training would completely break down after a few iterations

4. **Memory Leaks**
   - **Failure**: GPU memory would accumulate over time, eventually causing crashes
   - **Reason**: Tensors not being properly freed, especially during evaluation
   - **Solution**: Implemented explicit cache clearing and reduced memory footprint

5. **Data Loading Bottlenecks**
   - **Failure**: CPU became bottleneck during training with too many workers
   - **Reason**: Multiple workers competing for resources on a limited system
   - **Impact**: Slower overall training despite theoretical benefits of parallelism

## Configuration Changes

The configuration was updated to include:
- Mixed precision training (`"mixed_precision": "True"`)
- Reduced number of workers (`"num_workers": 2`)
- Added cache size settings (`"cache_size": 100`)
- Optimized prefetching (`"prefetch_factor": 2`)
- Learning rate warmup (`"warmup_epochs": 0`)
- Added support for Mixup and Focal Loss

## Code Structure Improvements

1. Organized model initialization code for better readability
2. Improved error handling with try/except and proper error reporting
3. Added better documentation for function parameters
4. Implemented proper PyTorch best practices for data loading

## Remaining Challenges

1. **Training Time**
   - Despite optimizations, training is still relatively slow
   - Further hardware upgrades or model simplification might be needed

2. **Model Complexity**
   - The GAT (Graph Attention) layers remain computationally expensive
   - Future work could explore more efficient attention mechanisms

3. **Dataset Size**
   - The ASVspoof dataset is large and requires significant storage/memory
   - More efficient data loading and caching strategies may be needed

These optimizations collectively addressed the key issues, making the model trainable on limited hardware while maintaining the potential for good performance.
